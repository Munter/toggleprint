Toggleprint lets you toggle the media attributes of your document stylesheets to visualize what the print preview would show, but in your browser window instead.
This gives you a very quick way to work with your print styles.

It is recommended that you combine this with some sort of live CSS reloading for a very quick development roundtrip.


Usage
-----

Toggleprint can be included via CommonJS, AMD or directly as a script tag.


``` javascript
// Toggle print mode on/off
togglePrint.toggle();

// Set up a hotkey that will toggle print mode on/off
// 'p' is the default hotkey
togglePrint();

// Set up a custom hotkey 'z' to toggle print mode
togglePrint({
  key: 'z'
})
```
